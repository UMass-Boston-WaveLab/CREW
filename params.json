Work in progress","body":"# PL-Security\r\n## ---\r\n**WaveLab** at University of Massachusetts Boston was founded in Fall of 2014 to conduct research on various properties of antennas and radio frequency signals. The research team is led by Dr. K.C. Kerby-Patel ( @kckerbypatel ), with two lab assistants Clara Gamboa ( @Aduwa ) and Eric Brown ( @brownericm ).\r\n\r\nThis code repository represents our first simulation efforts related to our research into whether or not a specific method of encryption key generation is as secure as it is assumed to be. This project touches on aspects of wireless channel simulation, information theory, and random processes.\r\n\r\nWe currently use **MATLAB** to conduct our simulation.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
