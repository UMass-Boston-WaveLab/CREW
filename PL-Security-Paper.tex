\begin{abstract}

Physical layer key generation techniques based on wireless channel fading are generally considered to be secure as long as any eavesdroppers are separated from the terminals by a distance greater than the channel correlation length.  In fact, this is true only if the channel observations are jointly Gaussian random variables.  A channel's transfer function is determined by the physical scatterers in that particular channel realization, and information about the communicating parties' channel may persist over significantly longer distances than the correlation length if the physical parameters of the channel are slowly varying.  Linear prediction has previously been employed to predict samples of the channel transfer function ahead in time.  In this work, we demonstrate that it is also possible to predict the channel transfer function in space, over distances larger than the correlation length.  This leads us to conclude that a more pessimistic ``safe'' eavesdropper distance for wireless fading based key generation is needed.

\section{Introduction}
It has been demonstrated \cite{azimisadjadi2007, bloch2008, mathur2008, ye2010} that two parties' reciprocal observations of a fading wireless channel can be used as a common source of randomness to generate symmetric encryption keys in cases where two parties cannot pre-arrange or securely exchange keys.  Each party transmits a predetermined waveform, which the other party receives and uses to determine the channel transfer function.  These measurements are assumed to be the same in both directions if completed within a short period of time, because of the channel's reciprocity.  Since the channel transfer function is also position dependent, eavesdroppers at other locations observe a different channel transfer function and the legitimate nodes' channel measurements are usually assumed to be secret.  In order for this type of link signature based keying to be useful as a practical encryption method, the secrecy of the channel measurements must be quantified.  This work examines how (and under what circumstances) an eavesdropper could predict the channel observations of the communicating parties.

The security of this key generation method is based on the assumption that if an eavesdropper is located farther than a correlation length from the communicating parties, it will have essentially no information about the symmetric key generated from their reciprocal channel measurements \cite{azimisadjadi2007, bloch2008, mathur2008, ye2010, he2013}.  Since the channel correlation function in many channels falls off quickly with distance \cite{jakes1974}, the minimum secure distance is often stated to be a half wavelength.  However, mutual information between two channel observation locations may be high even if the channel correlation function is low or has a minimum.  The channel transfer function is a deterministic function of physical environmental parameters.  Although these environmental parameters may be unknown, in they often vary quite slowly with distance compared to the correlation function of the channel \cite{jakes1974, duel-hallen2007}.  The mutual information between the channel parameters at two locations represents an upper bound on the mutual information between channel observations at those locations \cite{kckpVTC2015}.  Such information may persist over distances longer than the correlation length, so security claims based on the correlation length are inappropriate.  In this work, we apply channel prediction techniques \cite{duel-hallen2007} to investigate the distance over which it is possible to predict the channel transfer function.

A similar but narrower problem was identified by He \emph{et al}.~in \cite{he2013}.  That work pointed out that the correlation functions of some channels have broad peaks in the spatial domain, and fading-based security using such channels is vulnerable to correlation-based attacks based on linear minimum mean-square error estimation.  By contrast, the minimum secure distance discussion we present is not based on the width of the correlation function but on the mutual information between separated channel observations, which can persist even when the correlation function is highly oscillatory and has a narrow peak.  As a result, it applies to a more general set of channels and is not limited to those with low angular spread.  In order to predict a channel with wide angular spread, the eavesdropper in this work is assumed to use a spectral estimation technique.

Section \ref{mutualinfo} briefly summarizes the argument for a mutual information based minimum secure distance that was presented in \cite{kckpVTC2015}.  Next, in Section \ref{prediction}, we apply long-range prediction techniques to a series of spatial samples in order to predict the channel transfer function over distances greater than the correlation length.  In Section \ref{simresults}, we apply this technique to a simple simulated channel to examine the dependence of prediction length on the properties of the channel and the eavesdropper array. 

\section{Mutual Information vs.~Correlation}\label{mutualinfo} %this needs a better section heading?
The ability of an eavesdropper to estimate the communicating parties' encryption key depends on the mutual information between the eavesdropper's channel observations and the legitimate nodes' observations.  In the literature, the channel correlation function is usually used as a proxy for the mutual information.  In \cite{kckpVTC2015} it was argued that this leads to an inappropriately optimistic minimum secure eavesdropper distance, and an eavesdropper may be able to predict the legitimate nodes' channel observations despite being more than a correlation length away.  This section briefly summarizes that argument, which is the motivation for the channel prediction simulation that follows.

If two random variables are jointly Gaussian, their mutual information is a monotonic function of their correlation function.  Thus, observations of a wireless channel at two locations, $h(\mathbf{r})$ and $h(\mathbf{r}+\mathbf{\Delta r})$, have mutual information given by 
\begin{equation}\label{mutualinformationgauss}
I(h(\mathbf{r}),h(\mathbf{r}+\mathbf{\Delta r})) = -\frac{1}{2}\ln\left(1-\frac{R_h(\mathbf{r},\mathbf{r}+\mathbf{\Delta r})}{\sigma_h^2}\right)
\end{equation}
where $R_h$ is the correlation function, defined as usual, and $\sigma_h^2$ is the average power.
\begin{equation}
R_h(\mathbf{r},\mathbf{r}+\mathbf{\Delta r}) = E[h(\mathbf{r})h^*(\mathbf{r}+\mathbf{\Delta r})]
\end{equation}

If the two observations are not jointly Gaussian, the expression given in (\ref{mutualinformationgauss}) is merely a lower bound on the mutual information.  In general, the channel transfer function at a particular location is a deterministic function of a set of environmental parameters $\boldsymbol{\theta}$ at that location. The environmental parameters may be considered to be a random variable. The data processing inequality can be applied to find that the mutual information of channel transfer function values at two locations with environmental parameters $\boldsymbol{\theta_1}$ and $\boldsymbol{\theta_2}$ is bounded by the mutual information of the environmental parameters.
\begin{equation}
I(h(\boldsymbol{\theta_1},\mathbf{r_1}); h(\boldsymbol{\theta_2},\mathbf{r_2}))\leq I(\boldsymbol{\theta_1}; \boldsymbol{\theta_2})
\end{equation}

Observations of the channel are given by $\tilde{h}(\boldsymbol{\theta})=h(\boldsymbol{\theta})+n$, where $n$ is additive white Gaussian noise.  The mutual information between two observations is limited by the mutual information between the channel transfer function itself at those two locations, again by the data processing inequality.
\begin{equation}
I(\tilde{h}(\boldsymbol{\theta_1},\mathbf{r_1}); \tilde{h}(\boldsymbol{\theta_2},\mathbf{r_2}))\leq I(h(\boldsymbol{\theta_1},\mathbf{r_1}); h(\boldsymbol{\theta_2},\mathbf{r_2}))
\end{equation}

If the observations are close enough to each other spatially that the environmental parameter vector $\boldsymbol{\theta}$ does not change appreciably, the upper bound on the mutual information between two observations is the entropy of $\boldsymbol{\theta}$.
\begin{equation}
I(\tilde{h}(\boldsymbol{\theta},\mathbf{r_1}); \tilde{h}(\boldsymbol{\theta},\mathbf{r_2}))\leq H(\boldsymbol{\theta})
\end{equation}

This discussion has provided a lower bound and an upper bound on the mutual information between two observations of a wireless channel.  Clearly, significant room remains for variation between the two bounds.  However, it has been observed that environmental parameters are slowly varying spatially compared to the channel transfer function or its correlation function \cite{jakes1974, duel-hallen2007}.  This indicates that information about the legitimate nodes' channel may be available to the eavesdropper even if it is separated from them by more than a correlation length.   The correlation length merely indicates that the value of the correlation function is zero at a particular location.  

\section{Spatial Long-Range Channel Prediction Method}\label{prediction}
%belongs to Eric
As discussed in Section \ref{mutualinfo}, channel information may persist over distances greater than the correlation length. Therefore, long-range prediction techniques as in \cite{duel-hallen2007} may be applied to predict the channel from spatial samples. Rather than using long-range prediction to predict the channel transfer function ahead temporally as is the typical usage, it is predicted spatially.

It is assumed that the eavesdropper has knowledge of the location of one of the legitimate nodes, and has the ability to take a number of spatial samples along a line in the direction of that node.  Previous literature \cite{duel-hallen2007} has shown that spectral estimation can be applied to a temporal prediction scenario by estimating channel parameters and predicting the channel by constructing a new model of it. In experimental implementation with real-world channels, the channel parameters varied slowly enough that this prediction method was accurate within a Doppler wavelength. Therefore, it is a reasonable approach for the eavedropper to reconstruct the channel with parameter estimation using spatial sampling and spectral estimation. 

%In temporal prediction applications, it has been observed that time variation of the amplitudes and frequencies in the sum-of-sinusoids model is on the order of 0.1 seconds \cite{duel-hallen2007}. 

\begin{figure}[ht!]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[height=2.5in]{Scenario}
\caption{Depiction of an outdoor environment with two transmitters (Alice and Bob) and an eavesdropper (Eve).}\label{scene}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

The channel model is shown in Figure \ref{scene}. Alice and Bob are both trancievers. Eve is an eavesdropper sampling array in line with Bob. Scatterers are represented by the objects between Alice and Bob. It has been observed that most real world channels contain less than 10 large scatterers \cite{duel-hallen2000}. 

In the simulation it is assumed that the sender Alice and all the scatterers reside in the far field of the eavesdropper array as well as the desired estimation location. The eavesdropper uses direction of arrival techniques to estimate the amplitudes and spatial frequencies of the scattering paths. Once the eavesdropper estimates the channel parameters, it uses them to reconstruct the channel transfer function. To achieve this an array of samples of length $Md$ is constructed, where $d$ is the spacing between measurements, $M$ is the number of spatial samples. The eavesdropper is intending to reconcruct the channel out to a length of $(M+q)d$, where $q$ is the distance between the end of the sampling array and Bob. 

Equation \ref{chan} describes the channel transfer function along the line of eavesdropper samples.

\begin{equation}\label{chan}
H_m= \sum_{n=1}^N \alpha_n e^{-j(k_n)md}
\end{equation}

 $H_m$ is the channel transfer function at the $m^{\mathrm{th}}$ location, $N$ is the number of scatterers, $\alpha_n$ is the $n^{\mathrm{th}}$ complex amplitude, and $k_n$ is the spatial frequency of that scatterer along the sampling array.  

The solution to the parameter estimation problem can be broken into two parts: estimating the wave numbers $k_n$ , then estimating the complex amplitudes $\alpha_n$. The simulated eavesdropper uses the rootMUSIC algorithm supplied in MATLAB to determine the spatial frequencies of the scattering paths \cite{matlab}. RootMUSIC uses eigenvalue analysis of the channel's correlation matrix to estimate the signal's frequency content. The specific command used takes the sampling results as well as a threshold value which serves to separate the noise subspace from the signal subspace. It then estimates the discrete frequency spectrum, as well as providing the signal power. 

In order to determine complex amplitude we used the method described in \cite{andersen1999}. The spectral estimation algorithm determines the spatial frequency of each scattering path. Constant spatial sampling is used, so (\ref{chan}) is simplified by substituting the signal poles $z_n$ for the complex exponentials.

\begin{equation}\label{complexamp}
h_m = \sum_{n=1}^N \alpha_n e^{-j(k_n)md} = \sum_{n=1}^N \alpha_n z_n^m
\end{equation}

Based on the estimated values of the signal poles, the complex amplitudes can be derived by solving the following linear equations. $\boldsymbol{A}$ is a Vandermonde matric of signal poles, where the $M^\mathrm{th}$ row contains all the poles raised to the $(M-1)^\mathrm{th}$ power. 

\begin{equation}\label{matrix}
\mathbf{h} = \mathbf{A \boldsymbol{\alpha}}
\end{equation}

which is a system of linear equations of complex amplitude $\boldsymbol{\alpha^T} = [\alpha_1, \alpha_2,... ,\alpha_M]$. The estimated complex amplitudes $\hat{\alpha}$ are then found by solving (\ref{matrix}) for $\alpha$ \cite{andersen1999}.

\begin{equation}\label{ahat}
\boldsymbol{\hat{\alpha}}=\boldsymbol{(A^HA)^{-1}A^Hh}
\end{equation}



%direction of arrival applications typically take many snapshots of

The weakness of using spectral estimation, and rootMUSIC in particular, is the sensitivity to noise in the signal. Direction of arrival applications typically take many snapshots over a span of time and average them to mitigate noise. The simulated eavesdropper is assumed to use this same procedure. The result is an effective signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) increase by a factor of the number of averaged snapshots. 



\section{Spatial Long-Range Channel Prediction Simulated Results}\label{simresults}
%Should we take a baseline average prediction length at default values?

Section \ref{prediction} described the signal estimation process. In this section a Monte Carlo simulation is used to evaluate the average maximum estimation distance for the scenario with varying channel parameters. Each value of each variable which shows impact on the estimation outcome is simulated 1000 times. An average is assembled for each swept variable in the Monte Carlo. During each of the 1000 runs the sample number at which the error of the estimation exceeds 5\% is recorded. This error is computed by assembling an array, which is populated for each sweeping variable by taking the max value of each pass, dividing it by the number of runs, then adding it to the value of that array position. From a default scenario each parameter is taken over a reasonable span to determine the estimation's sensitivity to that parameter. The resultant average sample values are plotted against each swept parameter. The Cram\`er-Rao lower bound presented in \cite{kckpVTC2015} was used to identify suitable parameters for a default simulation scenario.  %insert graphs and refer to them 

%I changed the letter associations for agreement with earlier math.
The Monte Carlo simulation tests 7 different variables: $M$ the number of samples taken; $d$ sample spacing in terms of wavelength; $N$ the number of scatterers; $O$ the number of observation snapshots; $P$ the maximum number of sinusoids that make up the rootMUSIC estimate; $T$ the threshhold value used in the rootMUSIC algorithm to seperate the signal and noise subspaces; $SNR$ the signal-to-noise ratio.

\caption{Plot showing the increase of samples and array length improving the estimation quality, then deteriorating slightly past 300 samples. $d = 0.3\lambda$ is the default spacing interval}\label{M}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

Each variable is tested individually against the default scenario. The figures show the model's sensitivity to these variables. Figure \ref{M} shows the number of samples in the eavesdropper's sampling array. It is shown that the quality of the estimation increases significantly up to approximately 160 samples, then levels off. 160 samples with a default spacing of $d = 0.3\lambda$ corresponds to 48$\lambda$.

\end{center}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{spacing} shows the average maximum prediction length vs. spacing between measurements. There is a steady increase in the estimation quality of the array as the spacing increases. As explained before, the number of samples in a function of the length of the eavesdropper array and the spacing, so increased spacing reduces the number of samples taken. Reducing the number of samples appears to have little effect on the estimation quality as long as the array length remains constant.

\end{center}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{Scatter} shows the number of scatterers in the scenario. Predictably, additional scattering paths increase the complexity of the estimation problem. With this eavesdropper configuration, there is a constant drop-off in the quality of the estimation, with near complete failure at 10 scatterers. This is consistent with the behavior predicted in \cite{kckpVTC2015}. This deterioration can be limited by an increase in SNR. 

\begin{figure}[ht!]

\caption{This plot shows the SNR vs. average prediction length. Signal-to-noise ratio is the most important factor in the effectiveness of the estimation method.}\label{SNR}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{SNR} shows how increasing signal-to-noise ratio of the sampled signal greatly increases the estimation preformance and extends the averaged maximum prediction length. The default value for the simulations in all other tests was $13db$. Performance of the estimation drastically improves past $24db$, so rthe simulation uses averaged snapshots to increase the SNR.

\begin{figure}[ht!]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[height=2in]{numSnapshots}

\end{center}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{snapshot} shows the effect of one method to increase the effective SNR of the signal. Averaging multiple observation snapshots of the same channel realization has a great impact on signal quality. Given the ability to take multiple observations the resultant estimation is very accurate. This figure shows that for the default scenario 100 snapshots, which is typical for Direction of Arrival applications, is sufficient to significantly improve estimation performance, raising the effective SNR to $33db$.

\end{figure}

The rootMUSIC algorith uses this value to separate the signal subspace of the correlation matrix from the noise subspace. Eigenvalues below the threshold value $\lambda_{min} *thresh$ are assigned to the noise subspace\cite{matlab}. Figure \ref{thresh} shows the rootMUSIC modifier threshold plotted vs. the average maximum prediction length. %I don't really know what to say here. It's spiky, but I don't really know why

Figure \ref{sinusoid} shows the second modifier value for the rootMUSIC algorithm. This value specifies the maximum dimension of the signal subspace. For the default scenario, a value of 20 is optimal for prediction length.

\section{Conclusion}

It can be concluded by applying long-range prediction to estimate the channel transfer function that an eavesdropper could reconstruct a signal more than a correlation lenth away from the receiver's position.  This indicates that the minimum safe distance for secure key generation based on wireless fading must be reexamined.

In order to achieve this in the scenario constructed here the eavesdropper must know details about the environment, specifically the location of Bob. Besides knowledge, the eavesdropper would have to posses a sophisticated sampling array and the processing power to conduct the estimation.%what else?


%our analysis is potentially pessimistic because we assume the channel parameters don't change within the sampling interval - however, it may be possible to extend the estimation to include both the channel parameters and their first derivatives.  CRLB will increase because it usually increases with additional parameters.

%future work: do a scenario where the eavesdropper moves through space and see if we can do spatiotemporal channel prediction simultaneously, see about 2D eavesdropper arrays and other problem geometries (what if all the scatterers are in an arc of the space instead of evenly distributed? does it matter?), do a security analysis by estimating the error of the prediction(?), demonstrate spatial channel prediction experimentally, investigate the effect of mutual coupling between array elements on the quality of the eavesdropper's predictions
